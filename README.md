# [Magali's Favourites](https://github.com/magalifabri/magalis-favourites)

This project started as an exercise for the coding school BeCode in Belgium.

The purpose of the exercise was to learn the basics of creating DOM elements from a data collection (array) in JS.

The goal was to create a web page with an overview of cards, structuring the data from the array.

Later, the project was upgraded with an MVC structure, PHP backend with database connection, and admin panel to more easily add movies via API calls.
